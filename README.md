# Portfolio SPA
A simple Single Page Application with [my portfolio](https://jlholgado.com) using HTML and Bootstrap.

I use the Freelancer Bootstrap Theme that you can find [here](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/freelancer/) as the basis of the project.

Then I modified it and solved some issues in the theme like the mail php that wasn't working due to the location of the files.
